## Welcome to my repo! 
#### Iâ€™m an IT professional. I enjoy building and testing software, playing chess and socialising with smart people.
These are some of the areas I am focused on right now:
- Cloud engineering.
- Networking and Linux anministration.
- Azure, Docker.
- Programming Python, Java, C++.
- Customizing my Neovim for faster workflows (that's on going in parallel with anything else).
