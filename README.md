## Welcome to my repo! 
#### Iâ€™m an IT professional. I enjoy building and testing software, playing chess and socialising with smart people.
I enjoy technology and so there are a few areas of focus in my learning right now:
- Cloud engineering.
- Networking and Linux anministration.
- Azure, Docker.
- Customizing my Neovim for faster workflows (that's on going in parallel with anything else).
